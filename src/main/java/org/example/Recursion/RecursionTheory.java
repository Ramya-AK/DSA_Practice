    // while exicuting the function, function will store in the stack
    // main function is the first function in the stack
    // likewise, once function complets the exicution, it will come out from the stack


    // why we need recursion
    // 1. It helps to solve the complex problem easily
    // 2. We can convert the recursion solution into the iteration and vice versa
    // 3. Space complexity is nor constant bec of recursive calls


    // how to approch
    // 1. try to break the problem into the smaller problem
    // 2. write the tree
    // 3. check the return value



    // Tyepes of tge recursive relation
    //1. linear recursive relation =>  like fibonocy => but worst time complexity
    //2. divide and conquere rule relation =>  binary search


    // vvvIMp
    // 1. checks the Arguments
    // 2. Return type =>  should return the sub function if return type has mentioned => vvImp
    // 3. Body of the function
